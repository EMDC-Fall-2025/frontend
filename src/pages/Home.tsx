            The Engineering Machine Design Contest (EMDC) is an engaging,
            hands-on competition that challenges teams of 5th-12th grade
            students to design and build complex chain-reaction machines. Each
            machine must incorporate a specific contest theme while applying
            principles of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
            (STEM). Teams work collaboratively to solve engineering challenges
            using recycled materials, innovative ideas, and advanced components
            like mechanical systems, electrical circuits, chemical reactions,
            and more. The competition encourages creativity, resourcefulness,
            and problem-solving while giving students an opportunity to showcase
            their skills in a real-world context.
