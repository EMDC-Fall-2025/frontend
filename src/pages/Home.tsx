              The Engineering Machine Design Contest (EMDC) is an engaging,
              hands-on competition that challenges teams of 5th-12th grade
              students to design and build complex chain-reaction machines. Each
              machine must incorporate a specific contest theme while applying
              principles of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
              (STEM). Teams work collaboratively to solve engineering challenges
              using recycled materials, innovative ideas, and advanced
              components like mechanical systems, electrical circuits, chemical
              reactions, and more. The competition encourages creativity,
              resourcefulness, and problem-solving while giving students an
              opportunity to showcase their skills in a real-world context.
